# ICEBOX NATIVE
Icebox is a food management application that helps you keep track of what groceries you have
in your refrigerator and when they are going bad. It will suggest recipes to you based on your
expiring food items, saving you the hassle of deciding what to make for dinner and preventing food
waste by putting everything to use. It uses voice input to free up your hands for loading groceries
or preparing meals.
